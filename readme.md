Express_Mongodb
---------------

Hi there! This is a small application which makes use of Express framework and Mongoose to register users. This application was partially made by following the tutorial from [here](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/) but a LOT of modifications and improvements have been done.

This project was done for FOSSASIA under the umbrella of GCI (Google Code In).

Requirements:
--------------

You need to have mongodb installed on your system. This application was tested on Ubuntu 15.04

How-to:
-------

- Run `$ npm start`
- Open http://localhost:3000
